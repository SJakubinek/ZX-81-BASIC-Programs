# What is this?
These are some of my Sinclair BASIC programs I did as a child on the ZX-81, which was replaced by a C-64 a year later and I converted them on that machine. They are in german as I did them in german when I was a child.

## count1to10
Just a very simple program. It counts from 1 to 10. But imagine you're 5.5 years old in 1981 and this was your very first own program. It was pure magic to me telling this little black thingi what to do and it did it.

## count1to100
I wanted the ZX-81 to count to 100 then. But it threw an error. Lucky me, there was a good manual shipped with the ZX-81 and I figured out I need to clear the screen to go further. This is how it ended.

## hallo
"Hello World" ... The funny part about this is it wasn't my first program like it is usually. I even can't tell you why, but I think I ever liked math more then languages/words.

## hallo10times
Well this prints "HALLO" 10 times onto the screen. Nothing else.

## taschenrechner
I got into school and sadly we weren't adding numbers or substracting or whatever. No, instead we had to paint circles around things that were of the same type and count them. Boring! At home I wrote this little program, which I later may or may not have used for my homework. ;)

## zahlenraten
Usually you had to guess the number the computer picked. I made it the opposite way. Yes, you can cheat. But why you should cheat?!

# How to use
Look out for a programm called t2p, download it and follow the instructions. Then you can use it with ZEsarUX or another emulator or even with the real hardware.

# About me
I started programming at the age of 5 1/2 when a ZX-81 moved into our house.

The first program I typed in was from a book and it was [Wolf, goat and cabbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem). Then I got addicted and wanted to learn more and more. Thankfully there was a manual in which all the commands where described with some examples.

When people asked me what I want to do for a living, when grown up I immediatly answered:"I wanna programm stuff!" So I followed this dream ever since.
