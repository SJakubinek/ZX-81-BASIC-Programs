<p>I started programming at the age of 5 1/2 when a ZX-81 moved into our house.</p>

<p>The first program I typed in was from a book and it was [Wolf, goat and cabbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem). Then I got addicted and wanted to learn more and more. Thankfully there was a manual in which all the commands where described with some examples.</p>

<p>When people asked me what I want to do for a living, when grown up I immediatly answered:"I wanna programm stuff!" So I followed this dream ever since.</p>

<p>These are some of my Sinclair BASIC programs I did as a child on the ZX-81, which was replaced by a C-64 a year later and I converted them on that machine. They are in german as I did them in german when I was a child.</p>
