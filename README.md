I started programming at the age of 5 1/2 when a ZX-81 moved into our house.
The first program I typed in was from a book and it was [Wolf, goat and cabbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem). Then I got addicted and wanted to learn more and more. Thankfully there was a manual in which all the commands where described with some examples. Yes, I was already able to read and write at that age. Because I started to learn both at the age of nearly 4. The first years in school where kinda boring to me btw, but in the 1980's it was very unusual in Germany to skip a class.
When people asked me what I want to do for a living, when grown up I immediatly answered:"I wanna programm stuff!" So I followed this dream ever since.
These are some of my Sinclair BASIC programs I did as a child on the ZX-81, which was replaced by a C-64 a year later and I converted them on that machine. They are in german as I did them in german when I was a child.
